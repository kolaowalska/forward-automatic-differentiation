This code implements automatic differentiation (FAD) using jet expansion to compute the value of a funtion as well as its first and second derivatives with respect to multiple variables.
The `Jet` class represents a multivariate Taylor expansion of a function, storin gthe function's value, gradients, and Hessians, as well as provides operator overloading for basic arithmetic operations and mathematical functions.
This use of operator overloading allows the propagation of derivatives seamlessly during arithmetic operations and function evaluations. This approach is optimal for calculating derivatives of complex functions in a numerically stable and computationally efficient way by avoiding symbolic differentiation's complexity and numerical differentiation's inacurracies, such as finite differences.
